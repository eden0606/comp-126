      <p class="what-is-content">according to britannica, a <em>national park</em> is an area set aside by a national
        government for the
        preservation of the natural environment.</p>

      <p>A national park may be set aside for purposes of public recreation and
        enjoyment or because of its historical or scientific interest. Most of the landscapes and their accompanying
        plants and animals in a national park are kept in their natural state. The national parks in the United States
        and Canada tend to focus on the protection of both land and wildlife, those in the United Kingdom focus mainly
        on the land, and those in Africa primarily exist to conserve animals. Several other countries have large areas
        reserved in national parks, notably Brazil, Japan, India, and Australia.</p>
      <p>It is generally thought that the concept of a park or nature reserve under state ownership originated in the
        United States in 1870 and that the worldâ€™s first such park was Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, created
        through legislation signed by U.S. Pres. Ulysses S. Grant in 1872. However, some naturalists and others have
        argued that there is evidence that indicates that the creation of Yellowstone was predated by the creation of
        Bogd Khan Mountain National Park in Mongolia, which may date from as early as 1778.</p>
